Hi, this is my homepage. You can find my resume under Resume and a list of my publications in chronological order under publications. I am currently a Ph.D student at Georgia Tech under the supervision of Dr. Saibal Mukhopadhyay. I'm currently in my 3rd year. My research is focused on the development of smart cameras and low-power and low complexity machine learning algorithms for embedded vision applications. Feel free to shoot me an email.
