I am a Ph.D. student associated with the <a href="https://"www.robotics.gatech.edu>Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines</a> and the <a href="https://http://rail.gatech.edu//">RAIL Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~chernova/">Sonia Chervova</a>. I am interested in developing algorithms and theory at the intersection of machine learning, robot control and planning, with particular focus on efficient learning techniques for learning robot motions from humans. Over the course of my PhD, I have been fortunate to also work closely with <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots/">Byron Boots</a>, <a href="https://www.uml.edu/sciences/computer-science/faculty/ahmadzadeh-reza.aspx">Reza Ahmadzadeh</a>, <a href="http://www.mustafamukadam.com/">Mustafa Mukadam</a>, and <a href="https://harishravichandar.com/">Harish Ravichandar</a>.

I spent summer/fall 2019 as an intern at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/robotics/">NVIDIA Seattle Robotics Lab</a> working with <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/">Dieter Fox</a>, <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/person/nathan-ratliff">Nathan Ratliff</a>, <a href="http://www-personal.usyd.edu.au/~framos/Home.html">Fabio Ramos</a>, and Byron Boots. Before that, I have also spent a summer at the <a href="http://www.utrc.utc.com/overview.html">United Technologies Research Center</a>.
